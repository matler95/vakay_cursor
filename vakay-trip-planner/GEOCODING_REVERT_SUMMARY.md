# Geocoding Feature Revert Summary

## What Was Reverted

The geocoding from URL feature has been completely removed from the Vakay Trip Planner application. This feature automatically extracted location information and coordinates when users provided booking URLs for accommodations.

## Components Removed

### 1. API Routes
- **Deleted**: `/api/accommodation/scrape/route.ts` - The main geocoding API that scraped accommodation websites and used OpenStreetMap's Nominatim service

### 2. Database Schema Changes
- **Removed**: `latitude` and `longitude` columns from the `accommodations` table
- **Removed**: `idx_accommodations_lat_lon` index on coordinates
- **Updated**: `setup-transportation-accommodation.sql` to remove coordinate fields
- **Created**: `remove-geocoding-fields.sql` for database cleanup

### 3. Frontend Components
- **AddAccommodationModal**: Removed "Fetch details" button, coordinate state, and geocoding functionality
- **EditAccommodationModal**: Removed "Fetch details" button and geocoding functionality  
- **AccommodationList**: Simplified navigation to use address-based mapping instead of coordinates

### 4. API Updates
- **Accommodation API**: Removed latitude/longitude parameter handling and database insertion

## What Remains

- **Booking URL field**: Still available for manual entry (useful for reference)
- **Address field**: Still required for manual entry
- **Google Maps integration**: Now uses address-based navigation instead of coordinates
- **All other accommodation features**: Unchanged (dates, times, notes, expenses, participants)

## Impact on Users

- Users must now manually enter accommodation names and addresses
- No automatic detection of accommodation details from URLs
- Navigation still works but uses address-based mapping
- Simpler, more straightforward accommodation creation process

## Database Migration

To apply these changes to an existing database, run:
```sql
-- Remove geocoding-related fields from accommodations table
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS accommodations 
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS latitude,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS longitude;

-- Drop the index on coordinates
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_accommodations_lat_lon;
```

## Benefits of Reversion

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Removed dependency on external geocoding services
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminated web scraping and coordinate processing
3. **Better Privacy**: No external API calls for location data
4. **Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase with fewer moving parts
5. **Reliability**: No dependency on third-party services that could fail

The application now focuses on manual data entry, providing a more predictable and reliable user experience.
